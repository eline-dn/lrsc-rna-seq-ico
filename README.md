# lrsc-rna-seq-ico

This is the work accomplished during my 5 months internship for the EpICO platform. 

I am currently developping this page. 

What you can already find:
- several markdown notebooks containing most of my work during this internship
- the reference functions used in my code
- a toyset created by subsampling around 10% of the cells in the Seurat objects before QC containing the raw expression data for each condition at isoform- and gene-level

What you will be able to find in the next couple of days:
- upgrades to improve the code's readability
- a bookdown/ vignette to reproduce my code
